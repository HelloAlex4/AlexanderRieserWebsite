## What is the Synetobit Easy Bot?
The Synetobit Easy Bot helps anyone create a custom cryptocurrency trading bot without coding skills. It uses a simple, intuitive block-based system, allowing users to easily design and set up their bots by dragging, dropping, and connecting pieces. Even without coding experience, you can build a bot tailored to your trading needs. A testing interface lets you see how the bot performs before trading with real funds.

## The Creation
Easy Bot was developed from the original Synetobit trading bot. The idea came when a friend wanted to create his own crypto bot but had no coding experience. This inspired us to create Easy Bot—allowing anyone, regardless of technical skills, to control their trading strategies. We aimed to provide flexibility in strategy and risk management without complexity, so now, you don’t need to be a developer to design a bot tailored to your needs.

## How to Use Synetobit Easy Bot
Once launched, using the Synetobit Easy Bot will be simple. You can start building your custom bot with a block-based system, much like Scratch. It’s straightforward: create the logic visually, without writing any code. After building your bot, you can connect it to one of our supported exchanges via API keys or deposit cryptocurrency on the Synetobit platform. Then, test your bot’s performance in a simulation, tweak and optimize it, and get it ready for live trading. The whole process is designed to make bot creation smooth and stress-free.
